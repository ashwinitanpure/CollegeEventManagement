<ul type="disc">
<li>All teams must have at least 2 members and no more than 4 members.</li>
<li>Teams must stay together during the Treasure Hunt and are encouraged to work together to solve the clues 
and retrieve the coins from each location. Teams are encouraged to bring along a phonebook and/or a cell 
phone with internet access to locate addresses for locations once they’ve solved the clues.</li>
<li>Each team will be given a “Clue Booklet” at the beginning of the treasure hunt. All of the treasure 
hunt clues will be in the booklet. It will be up to the teams to decipher the clues and safely acquire the coin 
from each of the locations. Each clue once solved will lead you to a location where you will be able to collect
 a “Treasure Hunt Coin”. Whether or not all clues are solved and the coins retrieved teams must return to 
 volunteers.</li>
<li>Teams will be scored on the total value of the coins collected and the amount of time taken. 
Once all coins are collected teams must return to the finish in order to be counted as finished. 
Coin values will be determined based on the difficulty of the clue.</li>
<li>Each team must have a licensed driver with a valid drivers license.<li>
<li>Each team in the hunt is assigned a number. A paper with this number on it is provided to you at sign in 
on the day of the hunt. With the number facing out, tape this paper to the left rear window of the car/bike
 being used in the Hunt. It will be used by Hunt coordinators to spot check compliance with the safety rules.</li>
<li>The Treasure Hunt begins at 1:00pm.  “Clue Booklets” will be distributed to team members at that 
time and may be opened and the teams may start solving the clues and retrieving “Treasure Hunt Coins”.</li>
<li>Disqualification will result from any of the following<br>

    a. Reckless driving<br>
    b. Damaging any property<br>
    c. Interfering with other teams or their members in any way<br>
    d. Copying from other teams<br>
    e. Stealing from other teams<br></li>
