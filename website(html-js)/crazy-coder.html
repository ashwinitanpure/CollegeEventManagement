The objective of this event is to test students knowledge about working with different programming languages 
in different paradigms. The ability to think in other languages, to use various features of a language to 
solve problems will be tested.<br><br>
Round 1:<br>
It will consist of multiple choice questions with a single correct answer.<br>
Participating teams can take test in any one of the following two categories:<br>
1.	C/C++ to Java<br>
2.	C/C++ to Python<br><br>

The questions will be based on language syntax, algorithms and data structures. The marking scheme will be announced on the spot. This round will be conducted online, but in our campus. You will be provided access to the test only if you report at our event venue during the allotted time slot.
Round 2 (final):<br>
Each team will be given two problem statements. Each member is free to choose either one of languages out of the
 pair they have chosen. In the first half, each member solves one question in his/her chosen language. In the 
 second half, the codes written by each member of the team, will be exchanged, but not the problem statement 
 (each member will get his partner's written code, not knowing what that code actually does). Then each of the
 member has to "flip" (convert) the code into the language chosen by him/her. The output of the converted code
 must match the output of the original code. Both the codes will be tested against various test cases. Details 
 regarding time limit will be declared on spot.<br><br>

Rules:<br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The environment will be any 64-bit Linux variant OS (Ubuntu, Debian, Kubuntu,.. etc.).</li>
<li>No IDE will be allowed for programming. Only the use of text editors like gedit, vim, emacs, atom, sublime 
text is allowed. GNU debugger is allowed to test the program.</li>
<li>Participants must solve the problem at hand with the specified pair of languages chosen by them. Also the 
two participants can decide amongst themselves which programming language of the chosen pair, they wish to 
utilize.</li>
<li>For round 2, the time limit will be announced on the spot, but there will be two intervals. In the first 
interval, each member needs to solve the given problem in the language chosen by him/her. If either member
 fails to finish the program in the first half, that team is disqualified/out of the event. In the second half, 
 the codes will be exchanged and each member will convert his partner's code in his chosen language to generate 
 the same output without knowing the problem statement.</li>
<li>Extra points will be given for the efficiency of code, all input cases, error and exception handling and 
proper execution of code, meeting each and every requirement as stated in the problem statement, before and after 
code conversion. </li> 
<li>Participants must bring their valid College ID cards and the receipt of registration during 
 reporting. Otherwise, the participant may be disqualified.</li>
<li>Time slots will be allotted and participants are expected to follow them strictly.</li>
</ul>
