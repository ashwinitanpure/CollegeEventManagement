<div>
Traced-it is an event that tests participants ability to find out the hidden logic behind apparently disconnected 
entities. This event allows the participants to make the full use of their thinking capabilities to get to the 
results quickly yet carefully. It is an event for those who go beyond the traditional approach of identifying 4 
as 2 + 2, 3 + 1, 4 + 0 and so on.<br><br>
Round 1:<br>
This round will consist of multiple choice questions. 
Participants will be asked to identify patterns in the given problem inputs and outputs and choose the governing 
algorithm or code snippets from the given options. The teams with maximum number of logically correct answers to 
MCQs will proceed to the next round.<br><br>
Round 2:<br>
Teams will be allotted problem statements containing program input and their respective output. The teams will be
 asked to develop their own programs to solve the problem for any test case. The judging criteria will be time 
 required to produce error free code as well as the code efficiency. Participants are expected to follow good 
 coding practices.<br><br>

Rules:<br>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The environment will be either Ubuntu 14.04 OS with gedit/vim/emacs as text editor and gcc as compiler OR 
Windows 7 with Turbo C / Dev C++ (as per the team's choice).</li>
<li>Participants need to bring their College ID cards and the receipt of registration during reporting.</li>
<li>Time slots will be given and participants are expected to follow it strictly.</li>
<li>Participants are expected to give their correct contact details, so as to inform them about the results.</li>
<li>Further details of the round will be disclosed at the time of event.</li>
<li>Rules may be changed without prior intimation. Participants are requested to check the MindSpark'18 website 
(www.mind-spark.org) regularly for updates.</li>
<li>In case of any disputes, the decision of the organizers and the judges will be final and binding to all.</li>
<li>Team members may be from different colleges/institutions but one participant may not be a part of multiple 
teams for the same event.</li></ul>
